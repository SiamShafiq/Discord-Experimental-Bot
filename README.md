Discord-Experimental-Bot

This was an experimental bot that I created to test out Discord's Python API

The functionality is limited to checking Win/Lose rates and posting them to the discord channel.
This bot also tracked the most frequent times that you would find someone online on discord.

To use the bot, you would have to adjust the fields marked with the credientials of your own server and set it up accordingly.

If you have any questions, please feel free to email me @siam.shafiq@gmail.com
